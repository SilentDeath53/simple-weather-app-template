# Simple Weather App Template
A guide on how to make a simple weather app.

1- Choose an API: OpenWeatherMap, Weather Underground, and AccuWeather. Choose one and sign up for an API key. I used OpenWeatherMap for this example.

2- Create a new HTML file: Create a new HTML file and add the necessary elements.

3- Add JavaScript Codes: Add JavaScript codes to fetch the weather data from the API and display it on the webpage. I gave this to you above.

4- Style the webpage: Add some CSS.

5- Test the app: Test the app by entering different locations.
